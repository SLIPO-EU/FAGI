# Fagi Command Line 
___
### Building from source
The following instructions were tested with git version 1.9.1 and Apache Maven 3.3.3. In order to build the command line version from source, you should first clone the master branch to a preferred location by running:

`git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/SLIPO-EU/FAGI.git fagi`

Then, go the root directory of the project (fagi) and run:
`mvn clean install`

### Run Fagi-gis from command line
Go to resources directory and change the config.xml and rules.xml as described below.

Then go to the target directory of the project and run:

`java -jar fagi-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -spec /path/to/config.xml`

### How to fill in the config.xml file
Inside the resources directory of the project there is a spec.template.xml file and a config.xml as an example for convenience. The Specification holds general configuration for the fusion process and is filled with text values between an opening and a closing tag. 
The `inputFormat` refers to the RDF format of the input dataset and the `outputFormat` holds the value of the desired output format. The accepted RDF formats are the following:

* N-Triples (NT)
* Turtle (TTL)
* RDF/XML (RDF)
* RDF/XML (OWL)
* JSON-LD (JSONLD)
* RDF/JSON (RJ)
* TriG (TRIG)
* N-Quads (NQ)
* TriX (TRIX)

In order to fill the `inputFormat` and `outputFormat` use the values of the corresponding parenthesis.

The `locale` is optional in case a dataset contains entities from regions with different locales, but it is strongly recommended to choose one when possible because it is used on several steps of the normalization process. The available locales are: 
* EN 
* EN-GB
* EN-US
* DE
* DE-DE
* DE-AT
* EL

The `similarity` is also optional and it is used as a part of the custom matching process (default is JaroWinkler). The available values (case-insensitive) are the following:
* sortedjarowinkler 
* jarowinkler
* cosine
* jaro
* levenshtein
* 2Gram
* longestcommonsubsequence

The `verbose` tag expects a boolean value `true` or `false`. If the verbose mode is activated the execution will produce a fusion log that contains all rules/actions that have been applied on each attribute of all POIs during the fusion process. All original and fused values of the properties of each POI will also be logged in this file. Additionally, the fused RDF output will contain triples that indicate provenance information about the POIs based on the fusion process.

The `stats` tag expects a value between `light` or `detailed`. The light version produces basic statistics and metrics as long as execution times. The detailed version produces the much more detailed list of statistics, but also requires more memory and time to compute. If the `stats` field is missing or empty, no statistics will be computed.

The `rules` tag expects the absolute path of the "rules.xml" file. 

The `left`, `right`, and `links` tags refer to the source datasets. Each of these XML tags contain additional tags that describe each of the datasets.

Specifically:

`id`: An ID to identify the dataset.

`file`: The filepath of the dataset. For the target (output) dataset.

`endpoint`: Optional tag. Instead of using files, add a SPARQL endpoint and leave the `file` tag empty.

`categories`: This is again optional. It is used to extract statistics about the categories of the entities. If you want to use this feature you should provide a file in N-Triples format that contains the categorization.

`date`: Optional tag. Denotes which dataset is the most recent. Format expected: yyyy-MM-dd

Specifically for the links, there are two supported formats. N-triples like `<poiA> <owl:sameAs> <poiB>` format and CSV like `poiA poiB score` (space separated and [0-1] value for the score). In the case of a CSV file, you can define three different modes. The first takes into account all the provided links and executes the fusion process accordingly, the second keeps unique links with the highest confidence score, and the third takes into account POI-ensembles by handling cases that a POI from one dataset is linked with multiple POIs from the other (the rules applied in this case are different and described at the rule specification below). The values are the following: 

* nt
* csv
* csv-unique-links
* csv-ensembles

Furthermore, the `target` tag refers to the target/output dataset and contains the following configuration tags:

`mode`: Specify the fused dataset mode. The supported modes are shown in the table below.

`outputDir`: This is the directory path under which all produced files will be written. The results should be one or two files with the fused datasets (based on selected fusion mode described below), and one file containing statistics about the datasets and the fusion process.

`fused`: Optional tag. Specifies the output filepath of the fused dataset (based on fusion mode). If no value is specified the default name will be "fused.nt" under the output directory defined above.

`remaining`: Optional tag. Specifies the output filepath of the non-fused dataset (based on fusion mode). If no value is specified the default name will be "remaining.nt" under the output directory defined above.

`ambiguous`: Optional tag. Specifies the output filepath of the dataset containing ambiguous linked entities. If no value is specified the default name will be "ambiguous.nt" under the output directory defined above.

`statistics`: Optional tag. Specifies the path of the statistics file. By default a file with name "statistics.txt" will be written under the output directory defined above.

`fusionLog`: Specifies the path of the fusion log file. By default a file with name "fusionLog.txt" will be written under the output directory defined above.

| Mode        | Description     
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| aa_mode | Only linked triples are handled: Fused triples replace the respective ones of dataset A (the fusion output is exclusively written on A). 
| bb_mode | Only linked triples are handled: Fused triples replace the respective ones of dataset B (the fusion output is exclusively written on B). 
| ab_mode | All triples are handled: Fused triples replace the respective ones of dataset A; Un-linked triples of dataset B are copied as-is into dataset A 
| ba_mode | All triples are handled: Fused triples replace the respective ones of dataset B; Un-linked triples of dataset A are copied as-is into dataset B 
| a_mode | All triples are handled: Fused triples replace the respective ones of dataset A; Fused triples are removed from dataset B, which only maintains the remaining, unlinked triples 
| b_mode | All triples are handled: Fused triples replace the respective ones of dataset B; Fused triples are removed from dataset A, which only maintains the remaining, unlinked triples 
| l_mode | Only linked triples are handled: Only fused triples are written in a third dataset. 

FAGI supports the prediction of validation and fusion actions with the use of ML models. These models are defined in the `ML` group tag. 

`name`: the path of the ML-model for name resources.

`address`: the path of the ML-model for address resources.

`website`: the path of the ML-model for website resources.

`phone`: the path of the ML-model for phone number resources.

`email`: the path of the ML-model for e-mail resources.

`validation`: the path of the ML-model for link validation.

ML-predicted actions on a property cannot be used if the corresponding ML model is not defined in the above tags.

### How to fill in the rules.xml file

The rules.xml file starts with the root element `<rules>`.
We set rules as a `<rule>` element inside the root tag. 

Each <rule> element consists of the following main childs:

`<propertyA>`

`<propertyB>`

`<externalProperty>`

`<actionRuleSet>`

`<defaultAction>`.


* `<propertyA>` and `<propertyB>` define the two RDF properties that the rule will apply.
* `<externalProperty>` is optional and is used to combine different properties inside a condition. The fusion action does not affect the value of this property. The external property requires an id attribute as a parameter in the XML and the id must start with the letter a or be that refers to the corresponding value (left or right) and followed by an incrementing integer for each different property used in the same rule.
* `<defaultAction>` is the default fusion action to apply if no condition from the <actionRuleSet> is met.

* `<actionRuleSet>` element:
This element consists of one or more `<actionRule>` child elements. 
Each <actionRule> is a pair of a condition and a fusion action, namely `<condition>`, `<action>`.
If the condition of an <actionRule> is met, then the fusion action of that <actionRule> is going to be applied and all the rest will be ignored, so the fusion action priority is the order of the <actionRule> appearance. 

* The `<condition>` along with the `<action>` are the most essential part of the configuration of the fusion process. 
In order to construct a condition, we assemble a group of logical operations that contain functions to apply on the RDF properties defined above.
We can define a logical operation by using the `<expression>` tag as a child of a condition. 
Then, inside the expression we can put together a combination of `<and>`, `<or>` and `<not>` operations. Î‘s operands we can use `<function>` elements containing a function or a nested <expression> containing more logical operations. The depth of the nested expressions supported currently is 2 levels of same logical operations. 

Except fusion rules which are defined with the `<rule>` tag, there is an option to add validation rules using the `<validationRule>` tag. With a validation rule we can accept/reject and/or mark a link as ambiguous in the model. The validation rules follow the exact same logic described above with the only difference being that the fusion actions are replaced with the validation actions, both described at the tables below.

* POI-ensembles rules are defined in the `<ensembles>` tag, in the same level as the fusion and validation rules. Inside the ensembles tag, we define `<functional>` and `<nonFunctional>` RDF properties that define the fusion strategy for each category. Functional properties are attributes that are supposed to be unique in a POI (such as address, website, geometry). The fusion action applied on these properties is keeping a unique value by a voting strategy (most frequent value will be kept). Non-functional properties refer to attributes that can have multiple values (such as name, phone etc) and the fusion action that will apply is keeping all values on different property URIs. In any case, the user is free to define which properties will be handled as functional/non-functional as semicolon separated values inside the corresponding tags. The link-validation process uses the already defined validation rules.

A sample rules.xml file could look like this: 

<rules>

	<validationRule>
		<externalProperty id="a1">phoneA contactValueA</externalProperty>
		<externalProperty id="b1">phoneB contactValueB</externalProperty>
		<actionRuleSet>
			<actionRule>

							<expression>
								<not>
									<function>isSameCustomNormalize(a,b,0.5)</function>
								</not>
							</expression>
						</or>
					</expression>			
				</condition>
				<action>reject-mark-ambiguous</action>
			</actionRule>
		</actionRuleSet>
		<defaultAction>accept</defaultAction>
	</validationRule>

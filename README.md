# Fagi Command Line 
___
### Building from source
In order to build the command line version from source, you should first clone the cli branch to a preferred location by running:

`git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/SLIPO-EU/FAGI-gis.git Fagi`

Then, go the the root directory of the project (Fagi-gis) and run:
`mvn clean install`
Tested with git version 1.9.1 and Apache Maven 3.3.3

### Run Fagi-gis from command line
Go to resources directory and change the spec.xml and rules.xml as described below.

Then go to the target directory of the project and run:

`java -jar fagi-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -spec /path/to/spec.xml -rules /path/to/rules.xml`

### How to fill in the spec.xml file
Inside the resources directory of the project there is a spec.template.xml file and a spec.xml as an example for convenience. The Specification holds general configuration for the fusion process and is filled with text values between an opening and a closing tag. 
The `inputFormat` refers to the RDF format of the input dataset and the `outputFormat` holds the value of the desired output format. The accepted RDF formats are the following:

* N-Triples (NT)
* Turtle (TTL)
* RDF/XML (RDF)
* RDF/XML (OWL)
* JSON-LD (JSONLD)
* RDF/JSON (RJ)
* TriG (TRIG)
* N-Quads (NQ)
* TriX (TRIX)

In order to fill the `inputFormat` and `outputFormat` use the values of the corresponding parenthesis.

The `locale` is optional in case a dataset contains entities from regions with different locales, but it is strongly recommended to choose one when possible because it is used on several steps of the normalization process. The available locales are: 
* EN 
* EN-GB
* EN-US
* DE
* DE-DE
* DE-AT
* EL

The `left`, `right`, `links` and `target` tags refer to the source and target datasets. Each of these XML tags contain additional tags that describe each of the datasets.

Specifically:
`id`: An ID to identify the dataset.
`file`: The filepath of the dataset. For the target (output) dataset, "System.out" is also accepted as console output.
`endpoint`: Optional tag. Instead of using files, add a SPARQL endpoint and leave the `file` tag empty.
`categories`: This is again optional. It is used to extract statistics about the categories of the entities. If you want to use this feature you should provide a file in N-Triples format that contains the categorization.

`mergeWith`: Specify the final fused dataset. The accepted values are `left` or `right` in order to merge with one of the source datasets, and `new` in order to create a new dataset that contains only the interlinked fused entities. 

### How to fill in the rules.xml file

The rules.xml file starts with the root element `<rules>`.
We set rules as a `<rule>` element inside the root tag. 

Each <rule> element consists of the following main childs:
`<propertyA>`
`<propertyB>`
`<externalProperty>`
`<actionRuleSet>`
`<defaultAction>`.


* `<propertyA>` and `<propertyB>` define the two RDF properties that the rule will apply.
* `<externalProperty>` is optional and is used to combine different properties inside a condition. The fusion action does not affect the value of this property. The external property requires an id attribute as a parameter in the XML and the id must start with the letter a or be that refers to the corresponding value (left or right) and followed by an incrementing integer for each different property used in the same rule.
* `<actionRuleSet>` is a set of condition-action pairs with priority the order of appearance.
* `<defaultAction>` is the default fusion action to apply if no condition from the <actionRuleSet> is met.

* `<actionRuleSet>` element:
This element consists of one or more `<actionRule>` child elements. 
Each <actionRule> is a pair of a condition and a fusion action, namely `<condition>`, `<action>`.
If the condition of an <actionRule> is met, then the fusion action of that <actionRule> is going to be applied and all the rest will be ignored, so the fusion action priority is the order of the <actionRule> appearance. 

* The `<condition>` along with the `<action>` are the most essential part of the configuration of the fusion process. 
In order to construct a condition, we assemble a group of logical operations that contain functions to apply on the RDF properties defined above.
We can define a logical operation by using the `<expression>` tag as a child of a condition. 
Then, inside the expression we can put together a combination of `<and>`, `<or>` and `<not>` operations. Î‘s operands we can use `<function>` elements containing a function or a nested <expression> containing more logical operations. The depth of the nested expressions supported currently is 2 levels of same logical operations. 

A sample rules.xml file could look like this: 

<rules>

	<rule>
		<propertyA>dateA</propertyA>
		<propertyB>dateB</propertyB>
		<externalProperty id="a1">label</externalProperty>
		<externalProperty id="b1">label</externalProperty>		
		<actionRuleSet>
			<actionRule>
				<condition>
					<expression>
						<function>isLiteralAbbreviation(b1)</function>
					</expression>
				</condition>
				<action>keep-right</action>
			</actionRule>			
			<actionRule>
				<condition>
					<expression>
						<not>
							<function>isKnownDate(a)</function>
						</not>
					</expression>
				</condition>
				<action>keep-both</action>
			</actionRule>		
		</actionRuleSet>
		<defaultAction>keep-left</defaultAction>
	</rule>
	<rule>
		<propertyA>phoneA</propertyA>
		<propertyB>phoneB</propertyB>
		<actionRuleSet>
			<actionRule>
				<condition>
					<function>isSamePhoneNumber(a,b)</function>
				</condition>
				<action>keep-left</action>
			</actionRule>		
		</actionRuleSet>
		<defaultAction>keep-left</defaultAction>
	</rule>	
	
</rules>

### Available functions:

* **isDateKnownFormat:** Checks if the given date String is written as a known format. The known formats are defined at the [specification](../master/src/main/java/gr/athena/innovation/fagi/specification/SpecificationConstants.java)
* **isValidDate:** Evaluates the given date against the target format.
* **isGeometryMoreComplex:** Checks if the first geometry has more points than the second.
* **isLiteralAbbreviation:** Checks if the given literal is or contains an abbreviation of some form.
* **isSameSimpleNormalize:** Checks if the two given literals are same. It normalizes the two literals with some basic steps and checks again if the first check fails. The check will be replaced with similarity metric and threshold.
* **isSameCustomNormalize:** Checks if the two given literals are same. It normalizes the two literals with some extra steps in addition to the simple normalization. The check will be replaced with similarity metric and threshold.
* **isPhoneNumberParsable:** Checks if the given phone number is consisted of only numbers or contains special character and/or exit code.
* **isSamePhoneNumber:** Checks if the given phone numbers are the same. Some phone-normalization steps are executed if the first evaluation fails.
* **isSamePhoneNumberUsingExitCode:** Same as above, except the exit code, which is checked separately using the input value.
* **exists:** Checks if the given property exists in the model of the given entity.
